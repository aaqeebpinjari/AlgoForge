# Export Features Documentation

## üé• Visualization Export Features

The AlgoVisualizer now includes powerful export functionality that allows you to capture and share your algorithm visualizations.

### üì∏ Available Export Options

#### 1. **Snapshot Export**
- **What it does**: Captures the current state of the visualization as a high-quality PNG image
- **When to use**: Perfect for capturing key moments in an algorithm's execution
- **How to use**: Click the "üì∏ Take Snapshot" button anytime during or after visualization

#### 2. **Recording Export**
- **What it does**: Records the entire algorithm execution as a series of frames
- **Format options**: 
  - GIF (animated, web-friendly)
  - MP4 (video format, presentation-ready)
- **How to use**: 
  1. Click "üìπ Export" to open the export panel
  2. Choose your format and frame rate
  3. Click "üî¥ Start Recording"
  4. Run your algorithm visualization
  5. Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" when done

### ‚öôÔ∏è Export Settings

#### Frame Rate Options
- **1 FPS (Slow)**: Best for detailed step-by-step analysis
- **2 FPS (Normal)**: Good balance between file size and smoothness
- **4 FPS (Fast)**: Smooth animations, larger file sizes
- **8 FPS (Very Fast)**: Professional quality, suitable for presentations

#### Format Selection
- **GIF**: 
  - Pros: Web-friendly, easy to share, automatically loops
  - Cons: Limited colors, larger file sizes for long recordings
  - Best for: Social media, documentation, web embedding
  
- **MP4**: 
  - Pros: High quality, efficient compression, widely supported
  - Cons: May require additional software for some platforms
  - Best for: Presentations, tutorials, professional use

### üéØ Use Cases

#### **Educational Presentations**
```
1. Set up your algorithm with desired array size
2. Start recording at 2-4 FPS
3. Run the visualization
4. Export as MP4 for classroom presentations
```

#### **Social Media Sharing**
```
1. Use smaller array sizes (15-25 elements)
2. Record at 4-8 FPS for smooth animation
3. Export as GIF for easy sharing
```

#### **Documentation & Tutorials**
```
1. Take snapshots of key algorithm states
2. Record complete runs for step-by-step guides
3. Export as both GIF and MP4 for flexibility
```

#### **Research & Analysis**
```
1. Record multiple algorithm runs
2. Use 1-2 FPS for detailed frame-by-frame analysis
3. Export timing information for performance comparison
```

### üí° Tips for Best Results

#### **Recording Quality**
- Use Chrome or Edge browsers for best compatibility
- Ensure stable internet connection when loading html2canvas
- Close unnecessary browser tabs to improve performance
- Use fullscreen mode for higher resolution exports

#### **File Size Management**
- Lower frame rates = smaller files
- Shorter recordings = smaller files
- GIF format is generally larger than MP4 for long recordings
- Consider array size impact on visual complexity

#### **Performance Optimization**
- Start recording before running the algorithm
- Avoid switching tabs during recording
- Use moderate animation speeds (100-300ms delay)
- Stop recording promptly when visualization completes

### üîß Technical Details

#### **Browser Compatibility**
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full feature support
- **Firefox**: Basic support, some limitations
- **Safari**: Limited support for advanced features
- **Mobile**: Basic snapshot functionality only

#### **Dependencies**
- **html2canvas**: Dynamically loaded for high-quality screenshots
- **Native Canvas API**: Fallback for basic functionality
- **Blob API**: For file downloads and generation

#### **Limitations**
- Large arrays (50+ elements) may impact performance
- Very fast animations (< 50ms delay) may miss frames
- Network connectivity required for html2canvas loading
- Some CSS effects may not capture perfectly

### üöÄ Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- Real-time GIF generation
- Video editing capabilities
- Cloud storage integration
- Batch export functionality
- Custom watermarks and branding
- Export to various video formats
- Timeline scrubbing for recordings

### üêõ Troubleshooting

#### **Export Not Working**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure visualization container is visible
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Use a different browser if issues persist

#### **Poor Quality Exports**
1. Increase browser zoom for higher resolution
2. Use full-screen mode
3. Ensure good lighting if using custom themes
4. Try different export formats

#### **Large File Sizes**
1. Reduce frame rate
2. Shorten recording duration
3. Use smaller array sizes
4. Choose MP4 over GIF for long recordings
