    question: "What are sorting algorithms?",
    answer: "Sorting algorithms are methods for rearranging a collection of items (like numbers or names) into a specific order, such as ascending or descending. They are a fundamental part of computer science. You can learn more at GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/) or watch a great overview on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jCFUv-Xlqo",

    question: "What are searching algorithms?",
    answer: "Searching algorithms are designed to find and retrieve a specific element from a data structure. The efficiency of a search algorithm depends heavily on whether the data is sorted. For a detailed guide, check out the searching algorithm section on Programiz (https://www.programiz.com/dsa/searching-algorithms) or Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm).",

    question: "What are graphs in data structures?",
    answer: "A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. They are used to model relationships between objects, such as social networks, computer networks, or road maps.

    answer: "Absolutely! For tutorials and theory, GeeksforGeeks and Programiz and W3schools are excellent. For hands-on coding practice, which is crucial, LeetCode and HackerRank are top choices used for interview preparation. If you prefer structured video courses, platforms like Coursera and edX have great options from universities and companies.",
