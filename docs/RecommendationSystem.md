# Machine Learning-Based Algorithm Recommendation System

## Overview

The Algorithm Recommendation System is an intelligent system that suggests the most appropriate algorithms for a given dataset and constraints using machine learning. The system analyzes dataset characteristics, predicts algorithm performance, and provides personalized, adaptive recommendations that learn from user feedback and empirical benchmarking.

## Key Features

### 1. Dataset Analysis Engine

The system automatically extracts features from input datasets:

- **Statistical properties**: mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis
- **Distribution detection**: normal, uniform, heavy-tailed, multimodal
- **Size & dimensionality**: n, d, sparsity
- **Pattern detection**: sortedness, nearly-sortedness, duplicates, outliers, runs
- **Data type & structure detection**: integers, floats, strings, graphs, matrices

Produces standardized feature vectors used by ML models.

### 2. Machine Learning Model Integration

- **Classification models** to recommend the best algorithm for dataset features
- **Regression models** to predict runtime and memory usage
- **Clustering** to group datasets into behavioral families for template recommendations
- **Optional reinforcement learning** component to adapt recommendations from sequential user interactions
- **Model versioning** and explainability outputs (feature importance / SHAP-style summaries)

### 3. Dynamic Performance Prediction

- Predict empirical time complexity and absolute runtimes for candidate algorithms
- Forecast peak and average memory usage
- Provide confidence/uncertainty estimates (prediction intervals)
- Continuous retraining pipeline using newly gathered performance traces and user feedback

### 4. User Preference & Personalization

- Preference management (speed vs memory vs accuracy, learning-style preferences)
- Historical usage tracking to bias recommendations
- Weighted scoring system combining model predictions with user-configured priorities

### 5. UI / UX Components

- Recommendation dashboard listing top-N algorithms, predicted metrics, and confidence
- Explanation pane showing why a recommendation was made (feature importance)
- Comparison matrix: predicted performance for recommended vs alternatives
- Feedback controls (thumbs up/down, annotations) feeding back into the learning pipeline

### 6. Integration Points

- Hooks into existing visualization system to preview recommended algorithms
- Link recommendations directly to code implementations and runnable examples
- Connect to Performance Analytics Dashboard for empirical validation
- Persist recommendation history to user profiles and benchmark records
